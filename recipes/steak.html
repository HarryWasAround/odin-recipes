    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>Neither of us are great grillers, so this recipe comes in handy. So whether you’re like us
        and can’t grill, or if you’re a grill master but it’s 30° outside, this recipe for Pan Seare
        Ribeye with Garlic, Butter and Herbs will be your new best friend.</p>
    <p>You can serve this with just about anything as a side—baked potatoes, 
        mashed potatoes, cheesy potatoes , a side salad, sautéed veggies, green beans, asparagus, the list goes 
        on.  Shoot, for all I care, the steak is the star of the show and doesn’t even need a side!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound 1-inch thick ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons oil</li>

        <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>2 bunches rosemary</li>
        <li>2-4 cloves garlic, crushed (depending on the clove size)</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Season the steaks evenly with salt and pepper on both sides</li>
        <li>Place the steaks on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet or 9x13 pan (whatever the wire rack fits in).</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until smoking slightly.</li>
        <li>Place the steaks in the skillet and sear on one side for 30-60 seconds. </li>
        <li>Flip them and immediately add the butter, thyme, rosemary and garlic.</li>
        <li>As it is searing on the second side, tilt the skillet toward you to pool the butter. </li>
        <li>Using a spoon, continuously scoop and pour the butter over the top of the steaks, for 30-60 seconds.</li>
        <li>Rest the steak for at least 5 minutes before cutting into.</li>
